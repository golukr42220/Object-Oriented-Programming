# Pointer to Implementation (Pimpl)

**Overview:**

The Pointer to Implementation (Pimpl) idiom is a C++ programming technique aimed at improving encapsulation and reducing compilation dependencies by separating a class's interface from its implementation details.

**Motivation:**

In traditional C++ programming, the complete definition of a class, including its private data members and member functions, is typically placed in the header file (.h/.hpp). When clients include this header file, they must also include all headers upon which the class depends. This can lead to longer compile times and increased risk of compilation errors due to changes in the implementation.

The Pimpl idiom addresses these issues by allowing the class's private implementation to be declared and defined separately from the class's public interface. This way, changes to the implementation do not require clients to recompile their code, as long as the public interface remains unchanged.

**Key Concepts:**

`Public Interface:` The public interface of the class includes all the member functions and any necessary declarations, but it does not reveal the class's implementation details.

`Private Implementation:` The private implementation contains the actual data members and the implementation details of the class. It's usually defined in a separate header and source file.

`Pointer to Implementation:` Instead of directly including private data members in the class definition, a pointer to the implementation class is used. This pointer is typically allocated dynamically.

`Forward Declaration:` To avoid exposing the implementation details to clients, the implementation class is forward-declared in the header file of the public class. This way, clients only need to know the class's name, not its details.

`Reduced Compilation Dependencies:` Separating the public interface from the implementation reduces compilation dependencies. When the implementation changes, only the implementation files need to be recompiled, not the files that include the public interface.

Example:
Let's build on the previous example to provide a more detailed explanation:

```cpp

// public_class.h
#ifndef PUBLIC_CLASS_H
#define PUBLIC_CLASS_H

class PublicClass {
public:
    PublicClass();  // Constructor
    ~PublicClass(); // Destructor

    void doSomething(); // Public member function

private:
    class Impl;     // Forward declaration of implementation class
    Impl* impl_;    // Pointer to implementation
};

#endif
```

```cpp

// public_class.cpp
#include "public_class.h"
#include "impl.h" // Include the implementation class

// Constructor
PublicClass::PublicClass() : impl_(new Impl()) {}

// Destructor
PublicClass::~PublicClass() {
    delete impl_; // Release the implementation object
}

// Public member function
void PublicClass::doSomething() {
    impl_->doSomething(); // Delegate to the implementation class
}
```
```cpp

// impl.h
#ifndef IMPL_H
#define IMPL_H

class PublicClass::Impl {
public:
    void doSomething(); // Actual implementation
};

#endif
```

```cpp

// impl.cpp
#include "impl.h"
#include <iostream>

// Actual implementation of member function
void PublicClass::Impl::doSomething() {
    std::cout << "Doing something..." << std::endl;
}
```
**Benefits:**

`Encapsulation:` Clients only see the public interface, which hides the implementation details. This promotes encapsulation and information hiding.

`Reduced Compilation Dependencies:` Changes to the implementation do not require clients to recompile their code unless the public interface changes.

`Easier Maintenance:` With implementation details separated, it's easier to understand, modify, and maintain the codebase.

**Drawbacks:**

`Dynamic Memory Allocation:` The Pimpl idiom often involves dynamic memory allocation for the implementation object, which can introduce overhead and potential memory leaks if not managed properly.

`Indirection:` Accessing members through a pointer adds a level of indirection, which may slightly affect performance.

**Use Cases:**

- Classes with large or frequently changing implementations.
  
- Library or framework development where stable interfaces are crucial.

- Projects where compilation times need to be minimized.

**Conclusion:**

The Pimpl idiom is a powerful tool in C++ for achieving encapsulation, reducing compilation dependencies, and improving maintainability. By separating a class's public interface from its implementation details, it helps to manage complexity and promote code reuse. However, it should be used judiciously, considering the trade-offs involved in dynamic memory allocation and indirection.
