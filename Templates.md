Both function templates and class templates allow us to write generic code as in functions and class operating on generic types. Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which code is written in terms of types to-be-specified-later as we have been doing in this chapter by adding a template data-type/class.

The C++ Standard Library includes the Standard Template Library or STL that provides a framework of templates for common data structures and algorithms.

This type of polymorphism is also known as parametric polymorphism.

Just like in function overloading and operator overloading, the actual function/class to use is determined at compile time in case of templates as well and so templates is also a way to achieve compile-time polymorphism.
