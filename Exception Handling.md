Errors are the problems that occur in the program due to an illegal operation performed by the user or by the fault of a programmer.

Exception Handling is the process of handling errors and exceptions such that the normal execution of the system is not halted. Exception handling in c++ consists of three keywords 
namely- **try**, **catch**, and **throw**.
