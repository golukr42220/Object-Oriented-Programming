[Abstraction](https://www.scaler.com/topics/cpp/abstraction-in-cpp/)

**Abstraction** is defined as delivering only essential information to the outer world while masking background details, i.e. representing the required information in a program without showing 
the specifics. **Abstraction** is a design and programming method that separates the interface from the implementation.
