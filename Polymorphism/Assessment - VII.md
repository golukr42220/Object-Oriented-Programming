**Problem Statement:**

Since Employee class only acts as a base class and it does not make sense to create an Employee object directly, we can make it an abstract class.

- Update this code to use the following logic.
- Add the addresses of all the objects to the employees array like this:
```
employees[0] = &lester
```
- Convert the Employee class into an abstract class
- 
**Expected Output**
 ```
10500000.00
5500000.00
1150000.00
950000.00
10000.00
10000.00
```

```
