The word Polymorphism means having many forms (Poly: Many, Morph: Form).

Have we seen any form of polymorphism till now in this course?

Function Overloading???

Operator Overloading???

Yes, both function overloading and operator overloading are forms of polymorphism.

- Function overloading allows us to have a function in different forms (with different implementations)
- Operator overloading allows us to have an operator in different forms (with different implementations)
In both function overloading and operator overloading, the compiler decides which implementation of the function/operator to choose for a particular function call or operation.

This type of polymorphism is known as compile-time polymorphism.

Why is it not just called polymorphism?

It has a specific name 'Compile-time Polymorphism' because there is another type of polymorphism where the implementation is not decided during compile time. We'll learn about it in a later chapter.
